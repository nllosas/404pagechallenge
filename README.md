My first [devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge in the _"Responsive Web Developer"-path_: Building a 404 Not Found page. <br>

**The challenge:**<br>
Create a 404 not found page following the design. The page should be responsive. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories. <br>

**User story:** <br>
Create a 404 not found page following the design.

**Where:** <br> Demo is available at [Github repo](https://github.com/nllosas/404pagechallenge.git) and as a live app through [Netlify](https://404-page-not-found-challenge-nicollosas.netlify.app/) <br>

**Experience and what I learned:**<br>
At first I struggled a lot, I wasn't sure where to begin. On my first attempts I tried to replicate exactly what was on the figma example layout, but I realized that my page was not dynamic to the change in window size. I knew some things here and there from html+css but after tackling this challenge I was forced to go on Youtube and watch more detailed videos on how to resolve the problems I encountered. In the end I found this Youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKYsuU86-DQ&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwNC5ppZo_dYGVjerQY3xYU) by [Dani Krossing](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCharmefis) that had everything I needed to learn to replicate and complete the challenge.

I also had to figure out how to work with netfly and github to be able to show my solution

### Built With

- Just HTML and CSS
- [Google fonts: Inconsolata, Montserrat, and Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Features

- This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
