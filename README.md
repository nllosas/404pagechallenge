My first [devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge in the _"Responsive Web Developer"-path_: Building a 404 Not Found page. <br>

**The challenge:**<br>
Create a 404 not found page following the design. The page should be responsive. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories. <br>

**User story:** <br>
Create a 404 not found page following the design.

**Where:** <br> Demo is available at [Github repo](https://github.com/nllosas/404pagechallenge.git) and as a live app through [Netlify](https://404-page-not-found-challenge-nicollosas.netlify.app/) <br>

**Experience and what I learned:**<br>
When I started to adjust the design for different screen sizes, I struggled a bit because I started from the desktop design and tried to work my way down in screen size. I changed my strategy and started the other way around, by building the layout based on the smallest breakpoint at 375px. After that, I built the layout for the largest breakpoint at 1025 px and more. This made it easier to adjust the design in between these breakpoints.<br>

That said, I'm going to review media queries, since I was not sure in which cascading order to put the min-widths in the style sheet.

Other than that, I enjoyed working with the requirement to deploy the demo page as part of the workflow. That is something I going to work more with forward. <br>

I also enjoyed working with the README as a part of the workflow, and I got to review Markdown syntax.

### Built With

- Just HTML and CSS
- [Google fonts: Inconsolata, Montserrat, and Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Features

- This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- The application/site is created as a "mobile-first" and responsive layout, with major breakpoints at 10px, 768px, 1200px and 1500px and more.

- Other than the user stories, I added the link to my github account
